Pitch [rad] - pitch ranges from -pi/2..pi/2
Roll [rad] - roll ranges from -pi..pi
Yaw [rad] - yaw ranges from -pi..pi (note that in NED coordinate system this means that 0 is pointed N, pi/2 is E, -pi/2 is W, +/- pi is S)

1. Level flight

wind velcity = 0.0

Lift = weight

Thrust = Drag


The air velcity is  U = sqrt(GPOS_VelE^2 + GPOS_VelN^2 +GPOS_VelD^2)

angle of attack alpha = ATT_Pitch ??????

Power data: PWR_*

Lift = (1/2) rho * U^2 * S * CL(alpha)

Stall_Speed = sqrt(2*W/(S*rho*CL_max))

Plot alpha vs CL

Plot U vs diff PWR_*

 
2.0 Glide test

glide angle = alpha = arctan(VelD/sqrt(GPOS_VelE^2 + GPOS_VelN^2)) ????

D/L = CD/CL = tan(alpha)
